Data Types:

EntityType:
path: data/config/entities/typename.xml (list of ids in data/config/entities.xml, dynamically changed)
example: as originals
Note: the last added entity type has no blocking.

EffectType:
path: data/config/effects/typename.xml (usually data/config/effects.xml, dynamically changed)
example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<root>
	<Logic classname="GGL::CArrowEffectProps">
		<Class>GGL::CArrowEffect</Class>
		<Global>false</Global>
		<Duration>0</Duration>
		<Speed>1200.0</Speed>
		<GravityFactor>600.0f</GravityFactor>
		<HeightOffsetStart>160.0</HeightOffsetStart>
		<HeightOffsetTarget>120.0</HeightOffsetTarget>
		<Damage>0</Damage>
	</Logic>
	<Display classname="ED::CFlyingEffectProps">
		<Class>ED::CFlyingEffect</Class>
		<Model>XD_CannonBall</Model>
	</Display>
</root>

TaskList:
path: data/config/tasklists/tlname.xml (list of ids in data/config/tllist.xml, dynamically changed)
example: as originals

Technology:
path: data/config/technologies/tname.xml, (list of ids in data/config/technologies.xml, dynamically changed)
example: as originals

Model:
path: data/config/models/mname.xml and data/graphics/models/mname.dff (as well as referenced textures),
		(usually data/config/models.xml", dynamically changed)
example xml (see ED::CModelsProps::ModelData for full list of entries):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<root>
	<SelectionTexture>Selection_Building</SelectionTexture>
	<CastShadow>false</CastShadow>
</root>
example dff: as originals (note: hard to save/load, best possibility is a GTA blender tool)
Note: remember to load SelectionTexture as Selection Texture, if you are not using a vanilla texture.

Model Texture:
path: data/graphics/textures/tname.dds, data/graphics/textureslow/tname.dds and data/graphics/texturesmed/tname.dds
example: as originals (there is a git plugin to edit them, but you might want to edit them alongside models)
Note: cannot be loaded directly, gets loaded via the referencing model.

Selection Texture:
path: data/graphics/textures/tname.dds, data/graphics/textureslow/tname.dds and data/graphics/texturesmed/tname.dds
example: as originals (there is a git plugin to edit them)
Note: selection textures are referenced by the additional model data. they could get loaded without specifically loading them via modloader, but in that case, they will not get cleaned up properly.
Note2: water/shorewave.dds can also be modified with the same functions (but i did not test, if this actually does something).

Terrain Texture:
path: data/graphics/textures/tname.dds, data/graphics/textureslow/tname.dds and data/graphics/texturesmed/tname.dds
example: as originals (there is a git plugin to edit them)
Note: Terran Textures are referenced in TerrainTypes and WaterTypes (Ice Textures). They should get loaded without specifically loading them via modloader, but in that case, they will not get cleaned up properly.

GUITexture:
path: data/graphics/textures/gui/tname.png (full path as id used)
example: as originals
Note: GUI textures are used only for widgets. referenced by the gui xml and loaded from there without specifically loading them via modloader, but in that case, they will not get cleaned up properly.
Note2: Since GUITextures are not known until ModLoader finishes, it is best to load them on normal GameStart and SaveLoaded functions, together with all other GUI modifications.

Animation:
path: data/graphics/animations/aname.anm
example: as originals (note: currently no effective tool known to edit animations)

Upgrade Categories:
path: none (usually data/config/logic.xml, dynamically changed)
usage: add the Upgrade field to all EntityTypes that are supposed to be in the upgradecategory (you need at least Type for everything but the last).
		do not add the Category field, this will be set by the AddCategory function.
		last, call AddSettlerUpgradeCategory or AddBuildingUpgradeCategory with the upgradecategory name and the first entitytype.
		Note: Add the entitytypes in reverse order, so the id gets loaded properly.
Note: not all entity behaviors support upgrading. (as an example: darios hawk does not get removed and causes an infinite loop on destroying it.)

TerrainType:
path: data/config/terraintypes/tname.xml (usually data/config/terrain.xml, dynamically changed)
example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no" ?>
<root>
	<Logic>
		<Blocked>True</Blocked>
	</Logic>
	<Display>
		<Priority>500</Priority>
		<BaseTexture>StrangeTerrain</BaseTexture>
		<TransitionsTexture>Transitions01</TransitionsTexture>
		<SnowTexture>StrangeTerrain</SnowTexture>
		<Quads>4</Quads>
		<Color>
			<R>255</R>
			<G>0</G>
			<B>255</B>
		</Color>														
	</Display>
</root>
Note: remember to load BaseTexture, TransitionsTexture and SnowTexture as Terrain Textures, if you are not using a vanilla texture.

WaterTypes:
path: data/config/watertypes/wname.xml (usually data/config/water.xml, dynamically changed)
example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<root>
	<Logic>
		<Freezes>false</Freezes>
	</Logic>
	<Display>
		<Color>
			<Red>255</Red>
			<Green>0</Green>
			<Blue>0</Blue>
		</Color>
		<TransparencyFactor>0.005</TransparencyFactor>
		<TransparencyOffset>0.3</TransparencyOffset>
		<TransparencyMin>0.0</TransparencyMin>
		<TransparencyMax>1</TransparencyMax>
		<DrawShoreWave>false</DrawShoreWave>
		<Freezes>false</Freezes>
		<IceBaseTexture>Water/Ice01Base</IceBaseTexture>
		<IceDetailTexture>Water/Ice01Detail</IceDetailTexture>
	</Display>
</root>
Note: remember to load IceBaseTexture and IceDetailTexture as Terrain Textures, if you are not using a vanilla texture.
